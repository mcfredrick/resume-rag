A: Matthew Fredrick is a Senior AI/ML Software Engineer based in Chelmsford, MA. He currently works at Cisco on the AI Platform (Collaboration AI/Webex) team, leading AI safety, MLOps, and platform architecture. His background spans AI/ML engineering, audio software (C++/DSP), and mechanical engineering, with over 10 years of professional software experience.

Q: What is Matthew's current role?
A: Matthew is a Senior Software Engineer on the AI Platform team at Cisco (Collaboration AI/Webex), a role he has held since June 2022. He leads initiatives in LLM safety, MLOps platform architecture, synthetic data pipelines, and AI agent development, and serves as the go-to technical authority for MLOps strategy across the organization.

## AI/ML Experience

Q: What ML and AI experience does Matthew have?
A: Matthew has extensive hands-on AI/ML engineering experience at Cisco:
- Shipped LLM safety guardrails protecting millions of Webex users (content filtering, jailbreak prevention, prompt injection defense, toxicity detection)
- Architected a comprehensive MLOps platform using Airflow and MLflow
- Built synthetic data pipelines cutting data-creation effort by 90%
- Developed autonomous red-teaming agents for AI safety testing
- Built computer vision pipelines for real-time video enhancement
He works with PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Hugging Face Transformers.

Q: What AI safety and security work has Matthew done?
A: At Cisco, Matthew designed and shipped LLM guardrails protecting millions of Webex users — models for content filtering, prompt injection defense, jailbreak prevention, and toxicity detection. He built autonomous red-teaming agents to stress-test AI systems, identified mis-categorized edge cases in security classifiers to improve model accuracy, and led a multilingual guardrails PoC with linguistics partners.

Q: What MLOps experience does Matthew have?
A: Matthew architected a comprehensive MLOps platform at Cisco using Airflow for orchestration and MLflow for experiment tracking. He established organizational standards for continuous training, monitoring, and deployment adopted across multiple teams, built CI/CD pipelines with Weights & Biases integration for real-time visibility, and became the go-to MLOps technical authority across the organization.

Q: What synthetic data work has Matthew done?
A: Matthew designed and shipped a modular synthetic data pipeline at Cisco that cut data-creation effort by ~90%, enabling new training sets in minutes instead of days. It supports multilingual expansion and multiple classification domains including toxicity and harm detection.

Q: What AI agent experience does Matthew have?
A: Matthew built autonomous red-teaming agents for AI safety testing at Cisco and developed a comprehensive automated testing framework for AI agent validation with objective generation and notification capabilities. He also develops and contributes best practices for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Codex) to his team's knowledge base.

Q: What RAG or document ingestion work has Matthew done?
A: Matthew architected an OCR and document parsing pipeline at Cisco as a hosted service, taking it from proof-of-concept to production to enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows for Webex AI features.

Q: What computer vision or video work has Matthew done?
A: Matthew built computer vision pipelines at Cisco delivering low-latency video enhancements for millions of Webex users worldwide — including background blur, virtual backgrounds, and relighting — optimized for efficient performance across diverse hardware.
