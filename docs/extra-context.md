## Cisco / Current Role

Q: What did Matthew build at Cisco?
A: At Cisco (Webex Collaboration AI), Matthew built: an MLOps platform for AI/ML model lifecycle management using Airflow and MLflow; a synthetic data pipeline that cut data-creation effort by ~90%; LLM guardrails and safety features (content filtering, prompt injection defense, jailbreak prevention, toxicity detection) protecting millions of Webex users; an automated testing framework for AI agent validation; CI/CD pipelines with Weights & Biases integration for real-time visibility; a business metrics library standardizing collection across 8+ microservices with Grafana dashboards; a multilingual guardrails PoC with linguistics partners; an OCR + parsing pipeline enabling RAG document ingestion; and computer vision pipelines for video enhancements including background blur, virtual backgrounds, and relighting.

Q: What AI safety and security work has Matthew done at Cisco?
A: At Cisco, Matthew designed and shipped LLM guardrails and safety features protecting millions of Webex users — including models for content filtering, prompt injection defense, jailbreak prevention, and toxicity detection. He built autonomous red-teaming agents to test AI systems and identified mis-categorized edge cases in security classifiers to improve model accuracy. He also delivered measurable improvements to security classifiers through synthetic data pipelines enabling continuous fine-tuning.

Q: What MLOps experience does Matthew have?
A: Matthew architected a comprehensive MLOps platform at Cisco using Airflow and MLflow for AI/ML model lifecycle management. He established organizational standards for continuous training, monitoring, and deployment adopted across multiple teams, built CI/CD pipelines pushing metrics to Weights & Biases for real-time visibility, and became the go-to technical authority for MLOps strategy across the organization.

Q: What synthetic data work has Matthew done?
A: Matthew designed and shipped a modular synthetic data pipeline at Cisco that reduced data-creation effort by ~90%. The system supports multilingual expansion and multiple classification domains including toxicity and harm detection. New training sets can be generated in minutes instead of days.

Q: What video or computer vision work has Matthew done?
A: Matthew built computer vision pipelines at Cisco delivering smooth, low-latency video enhancements for millions of Webex users worldwide — including background blur, virtual backgrounds, and relighting, optimized for efficient performance across diverse hardware.

Q: What RAG or document ingestion work has Matthew done?
A: Matthew architected an OCR and document parsing pipeline as a hosted service at Cisco, taking it from proof-of-concept to production. This enables retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows for Webex's AI features.

## Previous Experience

Q: What did Matthew do at BandLab?
A: At BandLab Technologies (November 2019 – April 2022), Matthew owned audio software features from design to delivery for a global music-creation platform. He built cross-platform applications using C++, the JUCE framework, and audio plugin SDKs (VST/AU), and worked across GUI, DSP, user data persistence, and cloud integration in a distributed team environment.

Q: What consulting work has Matthew done?
A: Matthew runs DayJobDevelopment LLC as a software engineering consultant, focusing on AI/ML audio manipulation, music information retrieval, C++, JUCE, Python, DSP, and web technologies. He has delivered custom software solutions for clients across diverse technical domains.

## Skills

Q: What programming languages does Matthew know?
A: Matthew's primary programming languages are Python, C++, and Rust. He is most experienced with Python for ML/AI work and C++ for audio software and systems programming. He is also comfortable with JavaScript and web technologies.

Q: What cloud and infrastructure experience does Matthew have?
A: Matthew has hands-on experience with AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, Pulumi (Infrastructure-as-Code), and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.

Q: What ML frameworks and tools does Matthew use?
A: Matthew works with PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Hugging Face Transformers. For MLOps he uses Weights & Biases, MLflow, and Airflow. He also has experience with Grafana for dashboards and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

Q: What AI agent experience does Matthew have?
A: Matthew has built AI agents at Cisco, including autonomous red-teaming agents for testing AI safety systems and an automated testing framework for AI agent validation with objective generation and notification capabilities. He also develops and contributes best practices for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Codex) to his team's knowledgebase.
